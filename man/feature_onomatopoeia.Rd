\usage{
feature_onomatopoeia(data, doc_id_field, text_field, top_num = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe or tibble containing the text data and document id}

\item{doc_id_field}{unquoted field name identifying the field within the data
that represents the unique document id}

\item{text_field}{unquoted field name identifying the field name in data that
contains the text of the Tweet}

\item{top_num}{integer, the top n onomatopoeiaic words to create features from}
}
\value{
A data frame of document ids their associated onomatopoeiaic word features
}
\description{
Engineers features related to onomatopoeiaic words in Tweets.

  \itemize{
    \item{the count of the top_num onomatopoeiaic words in all Tweets}
  }

\examples{
tweets <- data.frame(status_id = c(1234, 5678),
                     text = c("I tweet about one thing #onething #things",
                              "I tweet about another #anotherthing
