The goal of twitterfeatures is to make it easy to engineer simple features out of Twitter Content.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sebastian-fox/twitterfeatures")
```
## Example

This is a basic example. It shows how to create sentiment features from the Tweets using 3 different sentiment dictionaries.

```{r example}
library(twitterfeatures)
tweet <- data.frame(status_id = c(1234, 5678),
                    text = c("Everything is great, happy and fantastic",
                             "Bored, sad, tired, grumpy"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

feature_sentiment(tweet, status_id, text)
```
